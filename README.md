# MIT-16.940 Final Project: Uncertainty-Aware Physics-Informed Neural Networks
This repository implements a uncertainty-aware physics-informed neural network (UA-PINNs) to learn parametrizations of ocean equations. Specifically, this repository is a pytorch-based reimplementation of the approach in [Zhang et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2019.07.048 "Quantifying total uncertainty in physics-informed neural networks"), which combines Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The implemented use-case is heavily based on [LÃ¼tjens et al., 2020](http://lutjens.scripts.mit.edu/me/docs/lutjens_ua_pinns_oceans_compsust_20.pdf "Uncertainty-Aware Physics-Informed Neural Networks"), which aims to learn parametrizations of ocean models. In this repository a very simple equation is used to demonstrate UA-PINNs, specifically a 1D stochastic elliptic equation. The motivation, approach, and results are detailed in the [write-up](https://github.com/blutjens/pce-pinns/blob/main/doc/main.pdf "Uncertainty Quantification in Physics-Informed Neural Networks").
